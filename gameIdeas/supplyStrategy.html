		<u><b>Game Idea, May 2020</u></b><br>
		So this month's game idea revolves around a classic war themed strategy game, but with a twist! 
		Instead of focusing on the fighting you're tasked with managing the logistics behind the war effort.<br>
		What does this look like?<br>
		Well it's really up to you but for what I'm envisioning there would be a few main points for keeping a good war effort:<br>
		-Frontline logistics, how is stuff getting to the troops?<br>
		-Support for the war at home, is the people behind the cause?<br>
		-Supplies able for shipment, where is the stuff for the troops coming from?<br><br>
		
		<u>Frontline</u><br>
		This is probably the most straight forward thing to think about. 
		How is it the troops are getting their supplies while fighting the good fight? 
		Things like supply truck routes, shipping lanes, and planned air drop locations would be some key things to consider. 
		When doing it you'd also need to think about how close your lines are to the front.<br>
		Are they in danger of sabatoge?<br>
		Will the enemy seize the supplies and use them against you?<br>
		How long can these troops last without a shipment?<br>
		Have they got enough supplies in reserve to hold out on or are they doomed?<br><br>
		
		<u>Home Front</u><br>
		Another very large thing to consider would be war support, but why?
		Nobody wants to fight an unpopular war is why. 
		Soldier surrender rates might be higher, they might abandon the war more often, and it could also lead to civil unrest which could limit the amount of supplies you can send.<br>
		Well this all sounds awful, how would you go about fixing it?<br>
		A few ways come to mind. 
		Propaganda campaigns praising the workforce, making it into a much larger cause than the individual. 
		Villanizing the enemy would also help. 
		You could make them seem pure evil and even a threat to the nation if not dealt with, that might only work so well though. 
		Increased wages on important sectors might also help but could have long term problems due to less productivity in left out sectors. 
		Could be good for short term boosts or to help sway the effort back to winning. 
		You could also consider scenarios driven by autocracy. 
		How would a dictatorship go about it? 
		Might provide an alternate game mode that could be interesting.<br><br>
		
		<u>Obtaining Supplies</u><br>
		The last big point the game I'm envisioning would have would be obtaining the supplies to provide. 
		Now a lot of this might be local production, which would make balancing home front support more important. 
		Other ways might include leasing from other nations. 
		This could be a decent way to get supplies but with all that extra spending it might cause some unrest on the home front. .
		Maybe it even leads to a reccession if done too long? 
		Sounds pretty rough and a good way to deter too much reliance. 
		The last big way would be seizing enemy supplies. 
		Encouraging troops to take the enemies stuff on capture and reusing it might be very good boosts, but it might also cause unforeseen consequences. 
		Maybe you haven't got a reliable way to get more ammo for the seized guns, they probably use different bullets and relying too much would make fighting get kinda tough. 
		Maybe your troops aren't as good using the equipment, after all they aren't very familiar with them.<br><br>
		
		<u>Other Thoughts</u><br>
		-Using spies or something similar to sabatoge the enemy could be interesting, but sounds possibly overpowered.<br><br>
		-This game would probably work best as an RTS but turn-based would definitely work with it as well. 
		Maybe if gone turn based your turns would have different phases for each concept, with the enemy also having these phases.<br><br>
		-Disinformation campaigns to lessen the enemy supplies or redirect them could be interesting and worth thinking about. 
		Maybe their people at home feel so hopeless they go on worker strikes?<br><br>
		-This is the first idea on the website so please leave feedback. 
		Did I leave it open ended enough for you to work with or did I not flesh it out enough? 
		I want to be a go to place for indie devs to look for ideas so any help is appreciated.
