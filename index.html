		<u><b>Game Idea of the Month</u></b><br>
			Strap in this month because we’re on a rogue mission to space, or rather we’ll be roguelike in space. 
			‘Now sushi’, I can hear you think ‘roguelikes are done to death. Being in space isn’t original enough to be an Idea of the Month is it?’. 
			And if that was all I had coming you’d be right! 
			But in a surprise twist straight outta left field this won’t even have a shred of combat. 
			We’ll be assuming the role of a space engineer straight outta academy and ready for hire by whoever offers high enough. 
			Got you’re attention? Good. Let’s jump into the gameplay then.<br>
			For what I’m envisioning the role of the player can be defined simply as ‘repair’. 
			They’ll be tasked with maintaining the ship through difficult situations and making sure nobody explodes in space. 
			Be it repairing the hull during a battle, repairing air ducts to keep oxygen pumping around the ship, or overriding faulty ship software to make things run smoothly they’ll always be on their toes doing a variety of tasks.<br>
			“Well how do they get parts to repair?” the inquiring minds amongst you might ask. 
			Before launching into space each mission you’ll be given a certain budget to go to the market and buy parts with, with the mission type hinting what systems are most likely to break (a strike mission would hint spare hull scrap while a neutron cloud might cause electrical interference). 
			But what’s it all for? Why do the missions? How does this classify roguelike? 
			Well between missions you’ll be able to spend money earned on all sorts of things and ‘spec into a class’. 
			Be it classes on better repair methods to level up a skill or the tools you use there’s plenty of room to specialize.<br><br>

			<u>Missions</u><br>
			Missions would be the main gameplay of the game, you can think of each one as a sort of dungeon but with a different skin. 
			They would be incredibly varied but ones I can think of easily are:<br><br>
			Combat missions, these might be a pirate raiding a station with you along for the ride to helping federation ships engaging a rival empire. 
			The primary risk here would be hull breaches so scrap metal to wield is advised<br><br>
			Trade convoy, these would be relatively tame low risk low reward kind of jobs. 
			Mainly for early game with the rewards not being worth the player’s time late game<br><br>
			Mining sampling, these would be somewhat risky missions with the player accompanying a ship headed into meteorite belts. 
			Scrap metal to wield is advised<br><br>
			Nebula mapping, these would be ships headed into unmapped portions of dense space where the energy patterns might behave in strange ways. 
			Spare computing elements might be handy as well as other electrical equipment<br><br>
			Rescue missions, these would be where the player is sent on a ship to repair another ship stranded in space. 
			These would be wild cards so anything can happen<br><br>
			Piracy rescue, when pirates act more tactfully they often remotely hack a trade vessels systems and reroute them towards a remote space for capture. 
			The player would board a federation rescue craft and attempt to regain control of the ships software before it’s too late. 
			Combat may ensue if things get  hairy<br><br>
			
			<u>Preparation</u><br>
			Mission preparation is vital. 
			The difference between starting a new run and making it out is being well prepared.<br>
			However maybe sometimes it’s worth not being the most prepared. 
			Sometimes maybe you can get by on less and pocket the money they think is going into equipment. 
			Or sometimes maybe, you just drive a hard bargain and convince them to allocate more money to you.<br>
			Yes that’s right, I’d like some of the fun of this game to be trying shave money off the equipment keeping your ship alive to instead be personal profit. 
			Because while keeping a reputation for not letting ships explode is cool, making more money is even cooler. 
			But why would you do such a thing? I dunno, maybe you’ve got loan sharks breathing down your neck. Maybe that new power tool just looks extra shiny. 
			The motive could largely vary but the end result stays the same: a nice system of the player trying to balance a fatter wallet with not starting a new run.<br><br>
			
			<u>Classes</u><br>
			Now I also mentioned classes, let’s get into that. 
			I can think of five main ways to play this game but if you decide to make it you can probably cater even more to your specific design.<br><br>
			Firstly, the obvious generalist. 
			Not amazing at anything but not terrible either. 
			This would probably be the safest way to play<br><br>
			The next three I’ll lump together: spec’ing into one of the three main skills much more than the other. 
			For obvious reasons this has inherit risk, but maybe the money you save on spare parts is worth it or maybe having such high skills enables unique ways to fix certain things. 
			Either way this would be a more interesting way to play if a bit riskier<br><br>
			Lastly is how I’d play the game, by just getting really good at negotiating. 
			You don’t need skill if you can just throw enough money and spare parts at all your problems. 
			For obvious reasons this is also the easiest way to exploit the game so I’d probably implement a minimum skill required to replace certain things with spare parts<br><br>
			
			<u>Other Thoughts</u><br>
			When you don’t have enough skill to do something, instead of plainly not letting you do it the game should instead have a chance of succeeding with the min skill having a relatively high chance<br><br>
			Personal items don’t need to be limited to plain skill and tool upgrades. 
			I think to give the game personality maybe you can buy trinkets that improve the way some factions interact with you or some crazy items that have bizarre effects or improve luck<br><br>
			You could tie in a story pretty easily to this but I don’t feel it’s strictly necessary. 
			However if you did an interesting thing to do would be to have whatever faction the player helps the most revealing more of their side of whatever the story is, so that there is no clear good or bad side<br><br>
			Having different design languages based on region of space would add more depth to the game. 
			Maybe the main federation has different looking ships and structures based on what the nearest home world is. 
			Maybe there are lots of sub factions of pirates all with their own iconic design type<br><br>
			You don’t need to do literally every mission you can. 
			The player should have the option of simply not doing missions they don’t want to. 
			If you wanted to you could penalize this though by giving them a worse reputation or something which would incentivize them to take risks on missions they normally wouldn’t do<br><br>
			Certain missions should rely on negotiating to have access to or the player should have a high enough relation to one specific faction<br><br>
			Items to rescue the player should be in the game, with limits. 
			Be it a distress beacon to pick you up after emergency ejecting from your now destroyed ship to contacting a faction to get you out of a particularly hairy combat scenario the player should sometimes have a chance to save their run. 
			Assuming they're in the right parts of space for it to work that is.
