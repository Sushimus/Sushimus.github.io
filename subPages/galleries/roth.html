			<u>About this PC</u><br>
			This was the first wooden computer case I've made so it is very rough however I did learn quite a few things while making it, hense why it's on this website to share.<br>
			Firstly, building a case with wood is very different than modding a case. 
			When you're building from scratch there's a lot more things to consider. 
			Airflow was a huge concern of mine while designing it, as was the functionality of the case and by extension form factor. 
			More on this later though.<br>
			After designing and accounting for these the next big issue was me having garbage wood working skills and the wood I use was warped by the elements and reused from pallets. 
			Part of the project not related to the case itself was this machine being ultra low budget, I set out to build it on less than 50$. 
			This is reflected in the parts you'll see later in the page. 
			I found the best way to assemble and cut it ended up being to cut two reference pieces, then make all the other peices the same as those (one for the width and one for the length). 
			You'll want to take it one step further as well, making the peices slightly too large then sanding them all into the exact dimensions you need. 
			Also when you do the sanding I did all the peices that matched each other at the same time just to be sure they were the same, I'm not a wood worker though so this might not be best.

			Next I got to nailing.<br>
			This is pretty simple so I won't bore you but I would like to point out coming up with somewhat creative design solutions for keeping it together does make for a more interesting case. 
			Personally I made these short bits to go vertically, then made them fairly semetric and placed strategically before nailing them. 
			This saved me from doing anything involving actual woodworking skill and gave me more options for making the case eleborate later.

			Looking on the inside you'll notice some. . particular design choices happening. 
			Due to the nature of the wood I was workng with I needed to make the shorter side a bit more broken up. 
			More importantly the case is very tightly packed. 
			This was to make setting it on top of a desk to use as a monitor stand easier, it does come at the price of upgradability. 
			Due to the abnormal shape and size of the motherboard I used that will be the only board able to fit in the case -meaning no more upgrades past this.
			Also you might have noticed the power supply.<br>
			<b>DO NOT OPEN A POWER SUPPLY</b><br>
			It can kill you if you touch the wrong parts. 
			I did it because I'm careless and because of the nature of the airflow of the case I wanted the top fan to blow air down onto it. 
			This eleminated the PSU fan which was loud and annoying to listen to. 
			On name brand PSUs this isn't much of an issue but this PSU in particular I got from a good will for like 3$.<br>
			You might have also noticed the little magnets in the corners. 
			I wanted it to be easy to access in case that was needed

			Now to the lid itself.<br>
			I designed it around two roles: providing all the airflow into the case and providing a stand for a monitor. 
			The massive fan on it does a fine job of cooling, all my parts were running 50C tops under stress tests. 
			As for the monitor stand part most cheaper monitors with a flat bottom stand worked fine on it. 
			Remember, this is a 50$ PC so it won't be used on a fancy gaming monitor with a three pronged stand. 
			While I was working on it I also tried throwing some foam I had about onto it. 
			I doubt it helped much but I at least wanted to try insulating against any high-pitched coil whine that might happen.
			Also if I remember correctly a local PC shop happened to have that fan in a case they gave me for free, which was splendid. 
			I guess they assumed they couldn't reuse it so they left it in.

			<u>Other Thoughts</u><br>
			My biggest complaint would probably be the amount of detailing work done. 
			Originally I was planning to do some wood carving as well as the burning but I wanted to give this to a friend as soon as possible so 'good enough' was my policy. 
			Just getting it to this point felt like it took four times as long as it needed to. 
			As for the burning itself: some of it is okay but alot of it is garbage. 
			This was partially from inexperience but had a lot to do with ym tools at hand. 
			All I had to do the burning with was a gas station lighter and a garbage Rosewill soldering iron (don't reccomend). 
			If given a second chance I'd like to try toying with painting something flamable like gasoline onto the parts I wanted to burn before trying to gas station lighter it. 
			That seems like it might be a decent way to go about it?<br>
			I'd also advice against whatever wood I used for the top and bottom. 
			It's awful to work with, especially when warped by weather. 
			I used it because of materials at hand and wanting to have a large sheet of wood for the top and bottom.<br>
			In case you're curious about the specs at hand. .<br>
			A Core2Quad 8400 is the powerhouse behind our computing paired with a blisteringly fast GTX460. 
			It also has a whopping 8Gb of ram and a 320HDD I wouldn't trust for anything more important than a photo of last nights dinner. 
			After the challege of the 50$ computer was done I did throw in a wifi card, which is what you see the blue usb cable going into. 
			My friend couldn't access a wall jack and I wasn't going to screw them for a budget challege.<br>
			All together it ran yesterday's AAA games just fine. 
			Borderlands 2 and Fallout 3 both ran on high at 60 fps with no frame drops.
