		<u><b>Game Idea, June 2020</u></b><br>
			This month we'll be sort of continuing the strategy trend of last month, but from a different angle and theme.
			What am I talking about? 
			A grocery store management simulator, which sounds boring at first but I think could impose interesting situations on the player. 
			So then what kind of ideas do I have brewing to make something worth playing? 
			Firstly, the obvious: the player would need to manage what gets sold, for how much, and where those items are in the store.<br>
			So next up is where things start to get interesting. 
			In addition to that each character in the game (customers, employees, etc) would all have their own personalities and moods.<br>
			To keep the spice flowing into the idea let's also consider the random events that might happen throughout the year.<br>
			Lastly let's add a dash of upgradability to everything, from the registers to the stocking equipment to the shelves themselves. 
			Sound like a decent game yet? 
			Good. 
			Let's get into it.<br><br>
			
			<u>Selling of Items</u><br>
			Obvious stuff first.<br>
			One of the largest aspects of any store management game is the buying and selling of the items and what those items are. 
			This is a big point for a reason. 
			If the player can't have a large swathe of options to choose from it feels less like it's their store and more like managing someone else's store. 
			You'd probably need at least three of every item to give a decent choice of things to sell.<br>
			I think it'd be neat to also have a factor of whether competitors are also selling those exact same brands, some people might prefer your store more if you carry more unique brands. 
			For produce you could also have options to buy local, whether the quality of the crop is better or even available to grow in that region is up to you.<br>
			For what I'm envisioning the player can try to become the Wal-mart of their region all the way to just being the best potato salesmen in known history. 
			They shouldn't need to rely entirely on a broad catelog to be profitable, other aspects of the store and general demand for the items in question should allow for crazy playthroughs to be possible. 
			To help the player determine what kinds of goods to carry and demand their is for those goods having different maps would help. 
			If you fancy you could even have the maps randomly generate with certain criteria the player could set (population, competitor stores, etc), this would help with replayability as each map might pose new challenges.<br><br>
			
			<u>Personalities</u><br>
			So next we start to get into the more interesting stuff. <br>
			Every single person in the store, from the customers to the staff, would have a few randomly assigned traits and a mood meter. 
			What do I mean by this? 
			Let's take a basic example: your typical Karen. 
			Every employees worse nightmare. 
			She would be considered to have the traits impatient and needy, meaning she asks for your employees help more often than normal and when being helped has a higher chance of being rude to the employee. 
			In addition when these traits trigger negatively, say the employee isn't well trained yet, she starts getting worked up. 
			Which in turn would trigger a negative modifier on other shoppers and employees. 
			This would make the shoppers more likely to leave sooner and buy less stuff and the employees to be more short with each other for the day.<br>
			This doesn't need to be all negative though. 
			You'd also have traits like kind, helpful, and patient which would act inversely. 
			They would boost the work speed of employees when triggered and help customers stay longer due to feeeling less pressure to leave.<br>
			Now this isn't all the traits in the world and the game would need probably at least 10 of each kind to feel dynamic but I think after it's done you start to have a very interesting system of balancing that occurs on the daily and makes every day less monotomous. 
			It could get even deeper though. 
			When choosing your employees you'd need to keep traits in mind. 
			Maybe some negative traits trigger others more often so when hiring the player would need to pick and choose their team and make tough decisions to keep workplace drama to a minimum. 
			To add more spice to choosing you could also have a hidden trait for employees that only shows after hiring, this still gives the player a decent level of control but would ensure they couldn't account for everything and have a dull game.<br><br>
			
			<u>Random Events</u><br>
			Random events, what do I mean by this? 
			All sorts of things of course.<br>
			From weather triggering based on the geography of the area to protests making it unsafe to open to shopping events like black friday. 
			These mechanics would be sparse but help break up the somewhat easy to manage mood and personality portion. 
			Picture this: the player is counting on a christmas shopping increase for their store, then a protest break out and they've got over stocked inventory they weren't able to safely sell. 
			Now they're stuck with a tough call. 
			Do they sell during protests anyways and risk fighting in the store or worse? 
			Or do they play it safe, hope they have enough in the bank to take a hit, and sell it as discount after it dies down? 
			I think situations like this would make for stories they could remember in the game.<br>
			In addition things like sandstorms or flooding might delay shipping of products or even damage merchandise. 
			Maybe even relatively small things happen: a shelving unit goes out and now 50 jars of gravvy are all over the floor. 
			The limits for what kinds of events and their rammifications are up to the imagination, but they're definitely something needed to make the game worth playing a lot.<br><br>
			
			<u>Upgrades</u><br>
			Now that most of the spice is out of the way let's talk upgrades.<br>
			Upgrades would serve two purposes: giving the player a better sense of control when everything hits the fan and somewhere to strive to so they'll have more content to enjoy. 
			Now there would of course be typical upgrades. 
			Things like better doors (manual to automatic), better registers, stronger shelves, etc. but I think there would also be another aspect of upgrades which gets less considered in the form of 'people upgrades'.<br>
			Better ads to target more specific customers, which would allow better control of the types of customers coming in and allow for more niche stores. 
			Better employee screening. 
			This might increase the odds of knowing hidden traits before highering or even if they have beef with someone alreayd working there. 
			Better security. 
			You get the idea. 
			If the player wants to run a reckless rodeo store where everyone is cowboy themed and rude they can, but equally if they want to run a more digified version of Wal-mart with a more tame target audience they also can. 
			This would allow for better control of the personality aspect, without making it completely controlled. 
			This would also take time to happen and be more of a late game thing the player would strive for to complete their store.<br><br>
			
			<u>Other Thoughts</u><br>
			I feel the game would best play as a real time, top down game similar to the style of Rimworld. 
			This obviously doesn't need to be the case but I think anything less would take away some of the hectic or strategic nature of the game.<br>
			Extra details to the mechanics might include more targeted protests. 
			Maybe when an inequality protest happens having a higher end store means your more likely to be looted.<br>
			You could also implement selling smuggled goods. 
			Maybe the region you're selling in have decided milk chocolate is witchcraft and anyone caught selling it needs to be fined. 
			Or maybe the country you're in forbids selling certain brands. 
			You could even make conditions for what is and isn't allowed randomized each playthrough to help mold the company the player builds.<br>
			Speaking of witchcraft this doesn't NEED to be modern age. 
			I think you could just as easily format it to be medieval or space aged. 
			Maybe you're even an intergalactic gas station that has solar dust storms, it'd certainly help give even more personality to the game (might come at risk of appeal to a larger audience though).<br>
			To make store layout more important you could make it so that customers can become frustrated when the store is poorly laid out, please tell me why the mayo is next to the deodorant.<br>
			For item variety maybe some items or brands only become sellable after you're a more established business. 
			This would help a more steady flow of content throughout the game.
